# Timesheet API

This project is a simple ASP.NET Core Web API for a timesheet system. It uses a CSV file for data storage and provides several API endpoints for managing timesheet entries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- .NET 5.0 or later

### Creating the Project

1. Open Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
2. Create a new project using the ASP.NET Core Web API template.
3. Name the project "TimesheetApi".

## Designing the API

The API includes the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/timesheets`: Retrieve all timesheet entries.
- `GET /api/timesheets/{id}`: Retrieve a specific timesheet entry by ID.
- `POST /api/timesheets`: Add a new timesheet entry.
- `PUT /api/timesheets/{id}`: Update an existing timesheet entry.
- `DELETE /api/timesheets/{id}`: Delete a timesheet entry.

## Data Storage

Data is stored in a CSV file named "timesheets.csv". Each row in the file represents a timesheet entry, with columns for employee ID, date, and hours worked.

## Implementing the Controllers

A `TimesheetsController` handles the API endpoints. It reads data from the CSV file for GET requests, writes data to the file for POST and PUT requests, and deletes entries from the file for DELETE requests.

## Models and DTOs

A `TimesheetEntry` model class represents a timesheet entry. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used for input and output data.

## Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is used to manage CSV file access. A service is created to read/write data from/to the CSV file.

## Documentation with Swagger

Swagger is enabled for API documentation. You can test the API using the Swagger UI.

## Testing

Unit tests are written for the controllers and services to verify that the API endpoints work as expected.

## Running the Project

Press `Ctrl+F5` to run the project without debugging. Access the Swagger UI at `https://localhost:<port>/swagger/index.html` (replace `<port>` with the actual port number).

## Note

This is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you'd likely use a database instead of a CSV file. But for a one-day project, this approach should work well. Good luck with your timesheet submission system! ðŸš€
